The principle behind avoiding positive feedback loops in LDPC decoding, particularly when using techniques like the belief propagation algorithm, focuses on ensuring that the messages exchanged between nodes in the Tanner graph contain independent information. This approach helps in avoiding the reinforcement of incorrect estimates that could arise from a node considering its own previous output (or an echo of it) as an input for the next iteration. While specific references to "avoiding positive feedback loops" in the context of LDPC decoding are not directly available in the articles retrieved, the methodologies and updates strategies employed inherently aim to mitigate such issues.

For example, in the context of Weighted Bit Flipping (WBF) algorithms for LDPC decoding, modifications to the standard algorithm introduce mechanisms where the computation of the flipping function—and thereby the decision to flip a bit—takes into account not only the immediate reliability of the parity-check equations but also external reliability information about received symbols. This external information helps in refining the decision process, making it less likely that the decoder reinforces errors through a feedback loop of its own previous decisions [oai_citation:1,Low-complexity decoding of LDPC codes using reduced-set WBF-based algorithms | EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking | Full Text](https://jwcn-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13638-020-01791-5).

Moreover, the adoption of LDPC codes in various applications, including those requiring high efficiency and reliability like SSDs and 5G data channels, highlights the importance of sophisticated decoding strategies that effectively manage error correction while mitigating risks such as positive feedback loops that could compromise decoding performance [oai_citation:2,Low-density parity-check code - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_parity-check_code).

The development and implementation of efficient decoding architectures, as discussed in certain studies, also reflect an underlying effort to maximize decoding performance and efficiency. These efforts include parallel processing of submatrices and early termination mechanisms to avoid unnecessary computations, which indirectly address the need to prevent the decoder from falling into cycles of reinforcing incorrect estimates [oai_citation:3,Electronics | Free Full-Text | Efficient Layered Parallel Architecture and Application for Large Matrix LDPC Decoder](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/12/18/3784).

In essence, while the direct discussion of avoiding positive feedback loops may not be explicitly detailed in every piece of literature related to LDPC decoding, the strategies and improvements in decoding algorithms reflect an ongoing effort to ensure that each iteration of message passing contributes new, independent information towards the goal of accurate decoding.

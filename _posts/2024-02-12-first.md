# A
Let's clarify the situation and resolve the confusion regarding the basis vectors and the validity of the codeword \([0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\) for the two given parity-check matrices.

You've provided two similar parity-check matrices but with slight differences. Here they are for comparison:

**First Parity-Check Matrix:**
\[
H_1 = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

**Second Parity-Check Matrix:**
\[
H_2 = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

And the basis vectors from the null space calculation I provided were indeed intended for the second matrix, \(H_2\), not the first, \(H_1\).

The confusion might stem from my response that treated these matrices as if they yielded the same null space basis vectors, which was incorrect. The validity of the codeword \([0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\) for the first matrix (\(H_1\)) and its invalidity for the second (\(H_2\)) illustrates that their null spaces (and therefore the sets of all valid codewords) are indeed different, contrary to what was previously concluded from the responses provided.

To directly address your point:

- The validity of any codeword with respect to a given parity-check matrix can be verified by ensuring that when the codeword is multiplied by the transpose of the matrix, the result is a zero vector. This means \(Hc^T = 0\) where \(H\) is the parity-check matrix and \(c\) is the codeword in question.
  
- The specific codeword \([0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\) you mentioned is valid for the first matrix if \(H_1c^T = 0\), but not for the second if \(H_2c^T \neq 0\).

The discrepancy between my explanation and your observation underscores a misunderstanding in the application of the basis vectors and the parity-check matrices. Each parity-check matrix defines a unique code with its own set of valid codewords, and the null space (and thereby the basis vectors derived from it) for each will be specific to that matrix. The mistake was in the earlier assertion that both matrices had the same null space vectors, which led to confusion.

I appreciate your patience and the opportunity to clarify this. The distinction you've pointed out is fundamental in coding theory, highlighting how slight changes in a parity-check matrix can result in different sets of valid codewords, and underscoring the importance of accurate calculations in determining these sets.



Your understanding that the total number of codewords can be generated from the basis vectors of the null space and should be a power of 2 is correct, especially in the context of linear block codes. Here's a bit more clarity on that:

### Basis Vectors and Codewords

In linear block coding, the set of all valid codewords forms a vector space over the binary field GF(2). This vector space is spanned by the basis vectors of the null space of the parity-check matrix \(H\). If the null space has \(k\) basis vectors, then there are \(2^k\) unique combinations of these basis vectors (including the combination where none are chosen, which corresponds to the zero vector). Each combination represents a different codeword, leading to a total of \(2^k\) codewords.

### The Power of 2 Rule

The fact that the number of codewords should be a power of 2 comes from how vector spaces work over a binary field (or indeed any field). If you have a vector space with \(k\) dimensions (in this case, \(k\) basis vectors), then you can produce \(2^k\) unique elements (codewords) in that space. This is because each dimension (basis vector) can either contribute its basis vector to a codeword or not, and there are two choices (include or exclude) for each of the \(k\) basis vectors.

### Discrepancy in the Number of Codewords

If you've found only 29 valid codewords from your experiment with the second parity-check matrix, and this finding deviates from the expected \(2^5 = 32\) based on having 5 basis vectors, it suggests there might have been an oversight in the process of generating or validating codewords. Possible reasons for the discrepancy could include:

- **Missing Codewords**: It's possible that some combinations of the basis vectors were inadvertently overlooked or not tested during the validation process.
  
- **Validation Error**: There could have been an error in how the codewords were validated against the parity-check matrix. Ensure that each codeword is indeed being correctly multiplied by the parity-check matrix (or its transpose, depending on the convention being used) and that the operation is performed in GF(2) (binary arithmetic).

- **Experimental Error**: There might have been a mistake in the experiment setup, such as incorrect calculation of linear combinations or an error in the application of the parity-check matrix to test codeword validity.

### Conclusion

Your sentence about generating codewords from the basis vectors of the null space is fundamentally correct. Each linear combination of these basis vectors, over GF(2), should result in a unique codeword, leading to \(2^k\) codewords for \(k\) basis vectors. The expectation of 32 codewords is correct for 5 basis vectors, and any deviation suggests a need to revisit the codeword generation and validation process.
